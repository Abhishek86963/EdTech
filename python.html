    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
        with the use of significant indentation.[33] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It
        supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
        functional programming.

        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language.
        Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.
        Beginning with Python 3.5,[34] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing
        optional static typing.[35] As of 2026, the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13,
        and 3.14, following the project's annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Python 3.15 is currently in
        the alpha development phase, and the stable release is expected to come out in October 2026."[36] Earlier
        versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates.</p>
