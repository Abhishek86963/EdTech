    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile, high-level programming language and a core technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and CSS. It is primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites, but its
        use has expanded to a wide variety of applications, including server-side development, mobile apps, and game
        development.
        Key Characteristics
        Multi-paradigm: JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and object-oriented programming styles.
        Dynamically Typed: The data type of a variable is decided at runtime, providing flexibility.
        Interpreted/JIT-compiled: It is an interpreted language, though modern JavaScript engines often use just-in-time
        (JIT) compilation for improved performance.
        Client-Side Scripting: In the browser, JavaScript runs on the user's computer, allowing for faster response
        times to user actions without needing to communicate with the server.
        Server-Side Capabilities: With runtimes like Node.js, JavaScript can be used for server-side programming, file
        handling, and database access.
        Standardized: The language is officially named ECMAScript and standardized by Ecma International (ECMA-262).
        Common Uses
        Web Development: JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages, such as drop-down menus, form validation,
        animations, and real-time updates.
        Mobile App Development: Frameworks like React Native allow developers to build cross-platform mobile apps for
        iOS and Android using JavaScript.
        Game Development: JavaScript is used to create browser-based games with libraries such as Phaser.
        Server-Side Applications: Node.js enables the building of scalable network applications and APIs. </p>
