    <p>MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database
        product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents (called BSON) with optional schemas. Released in February 2009 by
        10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version
        4.0). MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.
        Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH
        Alliance.
        The American software company 10gen began developing MongoDB in 2007 as a component of a planned
        platform-as-a-service product. In 2009, the company shifted to an open-source development model and began
        offering commercial support and other services. In 2013, 10gen changed its name to MongoDB Inc.
