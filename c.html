    <p>The C programming language is a powerful, general-purpose, procedural language developed by Dennis Ritchie at
        Bell Labs in the early 1970s, primarily for writing the Unix operating system. It is known for its efficiency,
        low-level memory access via pointers, and portability, making it a foundational language in computer science.
        Key Characteristics
        Mid-level Language: C combines features of both low-level languages (direct hardware interaction) and high-level
        languages (machine independence), allowing for efficient system programming.
        Procedural and Structured: Programs are organized into functions and code blocks, making them easier to
        understand and modify.
        Static Typing: Variables must be explicitly declared with a data type (e.g., int, float, char) before use, and
        the type system is checked at compile-time.
        Manual Memory Management: Programmers use functions like malloc(), calloc(), and free() to allocate and
        deallocate memory dynamically, providing precise control over system resources.
        Portability: C code can be compiled and run on a wide variety of platforms and operating systems with minimal
        changes.
        Case-Sensitive: The language is case-sensitive, meaning int and Int are treated as different identifiers.
        Primary Uses
        C is extensively used across various domains due to its speed and efficiency.
        Operating Systems: Core components of major operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS are built with C.
        Embedded Systems: Its small memory footprint makes it ideal for specialized devices like microcontrollers, smart
        TVs, and medical equipment.
        Compilers and Interpreters: Many other programming languages (including Python and Perl) have compilers and
        interpreters written in C.
        Database Systems: High-performance database engines, such as MySQL, are developed using C and C++.
        Game Development: C is used in creating game engines and graphics libraries (like OpenGL) where performance is
        critical.
        Learning Resources
        For those interested in learning C, numerous resources are available, including:
        Interactive Tutorials: Platforms like W3Schools and learn-c.org offer structured guides and examples.
        Documentation and References: Comprehensive language references can be found on websites such as Microsoft Learn
        and cppreference.com.
        Compilers and IDEs: To write and run C programs, you need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment
        (IDE) like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code, along with a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
        Online compilers, such as the one provided by Programiz, are also available for immediate practice. </p>
